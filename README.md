## Overview
Go-To-Peer is a decentralized application inspired by BitTorrent that enables users to upload and download files seamlessly. Designed with Go‚Äôs robust concurrency model, this application handles file chunking, peer discovery, and concurrent file transfers with efficiency and reliability.

### Key Features
- **File Chunking**: Split and reconstruct files of any size. 
- **Peer Discovery**: Connect with peers for decentralized transfers.
- **Concurrent Transfers**: Maximize efficiency with parallel uploads/downloads.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure secure and accurate file transfers with hash-based verification.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
